# About
<p>A portfolio is the face of a person, you need to approach this thoroughly. With these thoughts in mind, I started developing my own portfolio.</p>
<p>Since I'm a creative person, I couldn't make a "simple SPA from an existing layout" (it's incredibly boring), so I took on Blender, which was about 400 hours. and the Three.js libraries.</p>
<p>Three times I took on Three.js (Three attempts - Three.js). The first time I couldn’t even set the initial scene with the cube, the second time I couldn’t load the custom model, the 3rd time turned out to be the control one, and from this the creation of the “character” that you will see on the site began, as well as my cyber-picture for the 3D-World section.</p>
